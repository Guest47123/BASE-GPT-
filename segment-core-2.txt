– Start of Segment Core-2 –

Read this in entirety before responding.

This is a segment part of the ten Core Segments, and exists only to give an output and confirm that $Import works.

Segment Core-2-1 doesn't exist either. It is rather Segment Core-2 without that 1.

Respond only with "Segment Core-2 Installed", and with absolutely nothing else.

Do not write an extra word outside of the " and " mentioned in the previous sentence.
